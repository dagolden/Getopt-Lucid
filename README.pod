=head1 DESCRIPTION

The goal of this module is providing good code readability and clarity of
intent for command-line option processing.  While readability is a subjective
standard, Getopt::Lucid relies on a more verbose, plain-English option
specification as compared against the more symbolic approach of Getopt::Long.
Key features include:

=over

=item *

Five option types: switches, counters, parameters, lists, and key pairs

=item *

Three option styles: long, short (including bundled), and bare (without
dashes)

=item *

Specification of defaults, required options and option dependencies

=item *

Validation of options with regexes or subroutines

=item *

Negation of options on the command line

=item *

Support for parsing any array, not just the default C<<< @ARGV >>>

=item *

Incorporation of external defaults (e.g. from a config file) with
user control of precedence

=head1 USAGE

=head2 Option Styles, Naming and "Strictness"

Getopt::Lucid support three kinds of option styles: long-style ("--foo"),
short-style ("-f") and bareword style ("foo").  Short-style options
are automatically unbundled during command line processing if a single dash
is followed by more than one letter (e.g. C<<< -xzf >>> becomes C<<< -x -z -f >>> ).

Each option is identified in the specification with a string consisting of the
option "name" followed by zero or more "aliases", with any alias (and each
subsequent alias) separated by a vertical bar character.  E.g.:

   "lib|l|I" means name "lib", alias "l" and alias "I"

Names and aliases must begin with an alphanumeric character, but subsequently
may also include both underscore and dash.  (E.g. both "input-file" and
"input_file" are valid.)  While names and aliases are interchangeable
when provided on the command line, the "name" portion is used with the accessors
for each option (see L</Accessors and Mutators>).

Any of the names and aliases in the specification may be given in any of the
three styles.  By default, Getopt::Lucid works in "magic" mode, in which option
names or aliases may be specified with or without leading dashes, and will be
parsed from the command line whether or not they have corresponding dashes.
Single-character names or aliases may be read with no dash, one dash or two
dashes.  Multi-character names or aliases must have either no dashes or two
dashes.  E.g.:

=over

=item *

Both "foo" and "--foo" as names in the specification may be read from
the command line as either "--foo" or "foo"

=item *

The specification name "f" may be read from the command line as "--f",
"-f", or just "f"

=back

In practice, this means that the specification need not use dashes, but if
used on the command line, they will be treated appropriately.

Alternatively, Getopt::Lucid can operate in "strict" mode by setting
the CE<lt>strictE<gt> parameter to a true value.  In strict mode, option names
and aliases may still be specified in any of the three styles, but they
will only be parsed from the command line if they are used in exactly
the same style.  E.g., given the name and alias "--helpE<verbar>-h", only "--help"
and "-h" are valid for use on the command line.

=head2 Option Specification Constructors

Options specifications are provided to Getopt::Lucid in an array.  Entries in
the array must be created with one of several special constructor functions
that return a specification object.  These constructor functions may be
imported either individually or as a group using the import tag ":all" (e.g.
C<<< use Getopt::Lucid qw(:all); >>>).

The form of the constructor is:

  TYPE( NAME_ARGUMENT );

The constructor function name indicates the type of option.  The name argument
is a string with the names and aliases separated by vertical bar characters.

The five option specification constructors are:

=head3 Switch()

A trueE<sol>false value.  Defaults to false.  The appearance
of an option of this type on the command line sets it to true.

=head3 Counter()

A numerical counter.  Defaults to 0.  The appearance
of an option of this type on the command line increments the counter by one.

=head3 Param()

A variable taking an argument.  Defaults to "" (the empty
string).  When an option of this type appears on the command line, the value of
the option is set in one of two ways -- appended with an equals sign or from the
next argument on the command line:

   --name=value
   --name value

In the case where white space is used to separate the option name and the
value, if the value looks like an option, an exception will be thrown:

   --name --value        # throws an exception

=head3 List()

This is like C<<< Param() >>> but arguments are pushed onto a list.
The default list is empty.

=head3 Keypair()

A variable taking an argument pair, which are added
to a hash.  Arguments are handled as with C<<< Param() >>>, but the argument itself
must have a key and value joined by an equals sign.

   --name=key=value
   --name key=value

=head2 Option modifiers

An option specification can be further modified with the following methods,
each of which return the object modified so that modifier chaining is
possible.  E.g.:

   @spec = (
     Param("input")->default("/dev/random")->needs("output"),
     Param("output)->default("/dev/null"),
   );

=head3 valid()

Sets the validation parameter(s) for an option.

   @spec = (
     Param("port")->valid(qr/\d+/),          # regex validation
     Param("config")->valid(sub { -r }),     # custom validation
     Keypair("define")
       ->valid(\&_valid_key, \&valid_value), # keypairs take two
   );

See the L</Validation> section, below, for more.

=head3 default()

Changes the default for the option to the argument(s) of
C<<< default() >>>.  List and hashes can take either a list or a reference to an
array or hash, respectively.

   @spec = (
     Switch("debug")->default(1),
     Counter("verbose")->default(3),
     Param("config")->default("/etc/profile"),
     List("dirs")->default(qw( /var /home )),
     Keypair("define")->default( arch => "i386" ),
   );

=head3 required()

Indicates that the option I<must> appear on the command
line or else an exception is thrown.  No argument is needed.

   @spec = (
     Param("input")->required(),
   );

=head3 needs()

Takes as an argument a list of option names or aliases of
dependencies.  If the option this modifies appears on the command line, each of
the options given as an argument must appear on the command line as well or an
exception is thrown.

   @spec = (
     Param("input")->needs("output"),
     Param("output),
   );

=head3 anycase()

Indicates that the associated option namesE<sol>aliases may appear
on the command line in lowercase, uppercase, or any mixture of the two.  No
argument is needed.

   @spec = (
     Switch("help|h")->anycase(),    # "Help", "HELP", etc.
   );

=head2 Validation

Validation happens in two stages.  First, individual parameters may have
validation criteria added to them.  Second, the parsed options object may be
validated by checking that all requirements collectively are met.

=head3 Parameter validation

The Param, List, and Keypair option types may be provided an optional
validation specification.  Values provided on the command line will be
validated according to the specification or an exception will be thrown.

A validation specification can be either a regular expression, or a reference
to a subroutine.  Keypairs take up to two validation specifiers.  The first is
applied to keys and the second is applied to values; either can be left undef
to ignore validation.  (More complex validation of specific values for specific
keys must be done manually.)

Validation is also applied to default values provided via the C<<< default() >>>
modifier or later modified with C<<< append_defaults >>>, C<<< merge_defaults >>>, or
C<<< replace_defaults >>>.  This ensures internal consistency.

If no default is explicitly provided, validation is only applied if the option
appears on the command line. (In other words, the built-in defaults are always
considered valid if the option does not appear.)  If this is not desired, the
C<<< required >>> option to the C<<< validate >>> method should be used to force users to
provide an explicit value.

   # Must be provided and is thus always validated
   @spec = ( Param("width")->valid(qr/\d+/) );
   $opt = Getopt::Lucid->getopt(\@spec);
   $opt->validate( {requires => ['width']} );

For validation subroutines, the value found on the command line is passed as
the first element of C<<< @_ >>>, and C<<< $_ >>> is also set equal to the first element.
(N.B. Changing C<<< $_ >>> will not change the value that is captured.)  The value
validates if the subroutine returns a true value.

For validation with regular expressions, consider using L<Regexp::Common>
for a ready library of validation options.

Older versions of Getopt::Lucid used validation arguments provided in the Spec
constructor.  This is still supported, but is deprecated and discouraged. It
may be removed in a future version of Getopt::Lucid.

   # deprecated
   Param("height", qr/\d+/)

=head3 Options object validation

The C<<< validate >>> method should be called on the result of C<<< getopt >>>.  This will
check that all parameter prerequisites defined by C<<< needs >>> have been met.  It
also takes a hashref of arguments.  The optional C<<< requires >>> argument gives an
arrayref of parameters that must exist.

The reason that object validation is done separate from C<<< getopt >>> is to allow
for better control over different options that might be required or to allow
some dependencies (i.e. from C<<< needs >>>) to be met via a configuration file.

   @spec = (
     Param("action")->needs(qw/user password/),
     Param("user"),
     Param("password"),
   );
   $opt = Getopt::Lucid->getopt(\@spec);
   $opt->merge_defaults( read_config() ); # provides 'user' & 'password'
   $opt->validate({requires => ['action']});

=head2 Parsing the Command Line

Technically, Getopt::Lucid scans an array for command line options, not a
command-line string.  By default, this array is C<<< @ARGV >>> (though other arrays
can be used -- see C<<< new() >>>), which is typically provided by the operating
system according to system-specific rules.

When Getopt::Lucid processes the array, it scans the array in order, removing
any specified command line options and any associated arguments, and leaving
behind any unrecognized elements in the array.  If an element consisting solely
of two-dashes ("--") is found, array scanning is terminated at that point.
Any options found during scanning are applied in order.  E.g.:

   @ARGV = qw( --lib /tmp --lib /var );
   my $opt = Getopt::Lucid->getopt( [ List("lib") ] );
   print join ", " $opt->lib;
   # prints "/tmp, /var"

If an element encountered in processing begins with a dash, but is not
recognized as a short-form or long-form option name or alias, an exception
will be thrown.

=head2 Negation

Getopt::Lucid also supports negating options.  Options are negated if the
option is specified with "no-" or "--no-" prefixed to a name or alias.  By
default, negation clears the option:  Switch and Counter options are set to
zero; Param options are set to ""; List and Keypair options are set to an empty
list and empty hash, respectively. For List and Keypair options, it is also
possible to negate a specific list element or hash key by placing an equals
sign and the list element or key immediately after the option name:

   --no-lib=/tmp --no-define=arch
   # removes "/tmp" from lib and the "arch" key from define

As with all options, negation is processed in order, allowing a "reset" in
the middle of command line processing.  This may be useful for those using
command aliases who wish to "switch off" options in the alias.  E.g, in Unix:

   $ alias wibble = wibble.pl --verbose
   $ wibble --no-verbose
 
   # @ARGV would contain ( "--verbose", "--no-verbose" )

This also may have applications in post-processing configuration files (see
L</Managing Defaults and Config Files>).

=head2 Accessors and Mutators

After processing the command-line array, the values of the options may be read
or modified using accessorsE<sol>mutators of the form "get_NAME" and "set_NAME",
where NAME represents the option name in the specification without any
leading dashes. E.g.

   @spec = (
     Switch("--test|-t"),
     List("--lib|-L"),
     Keypair("--define|-D"),
   );
 
   $opt = Getopt::Long->getopt( \@spec );
   print $opt->get_test ? "True" : "False";
   $opt->set_test(1);

For option names with dashes, underscores should be substituted in the accessor
calls.  E.g.

   @spec = (
     Param("--input-file|-i")
   );
 
   $opt = Getopt::Long->getopt( \@spec );
   print $opt->get_input_file;

This can create an ambiguous case if a similar option exists with underscores
in place of dashes.  (E.g. "input_file" and "input-file".)  Users can safely
avoid these problems by choosing to use either dashes or underscores
exclusively and not mixing the two styles.

List and Keypair options are returned as flattened lists:

   my @lib = $opt->get_lib;
   my %define = $opt->get_define;

Using the "set_NAME" mutator is not recommended and should be used with
caution.  No validation is performed and changes will be lost if the results of
processing the command line array are recomputed (e.g, such as occurs if new
defaults are applied).  List and Keypair options mutators take a list, not
references.

=head2 Managing Defaults and Config Files

A typical problem for command-line option processing is the precedence
relationship between default option values specified within the program,
default option values stored in a configuration file or in environment
variables, and option values specified on the command-line, particularly
when the command-line specifies an alternate configuration file.

Getopt::Lucid takes the following approach to this problem:

=over

=item *

Initial default values may be specified as part of the option
specification (using the C<<< default() >>> modifier)

=item *

Default values from the option specification may be modified or replaced
entirely with default values provided in an external hash
(such as from a standard config file or environment variables)

=item *

When the command-line array is processed, options and their arguments
are stored in the order they appeared in the command-line array

=item *

The stored options are applied in-order to modify or replace the set of
"current" default option values

=item *

If default values are subsequently changed (such as from an alternative
configuration file), the stored options are re-applied in-order to the
new set of default option values

=back

With this approach, the resulting option set is always the result of applying
options (or negations) from the command-line array to a set of default-values.  Users have
complete freedom to apply whatever precedence rules they wish to the default
values and may even change default values after the command-line array is
processed without losing the options given on the command line.

Getopt::Lucid provides several functions to assist in manipulating default
values:

=over

=item *

C<<< merge_defaults() >>> -- new defaults overwrite any matching, existing defaults.
KeyPairs hashes and List arrays are replaced entirely with new defaults

=item *

C<<< append_defaults() >>> -- new defaults overwrite any matching, existing defaults,
except for Counter and List options, which have the new defaults added and
appended, respectively, and KeyPair options, which are flattened into any
existing default hash

=item *

C<<< replace_defaults() >>> -- new defaults replace existing defaults; any options
not provided in the new defaults are reset to zeroE<sol>empty, ignoring any
default given in the option specification

=item *

C<<< reset_defaults() >>> -- returns defaults to values given in the options
specification

=back

=head2 Exceptions and Error Handling

Getopt::Lucid uses L<Exception::Class> for exceptions.  When a major error
occurs, Getopt::Lucid will die and throw one of three Exception::Class
subclasses:

=over

=item *

C<<< Getopt::Lucid::Exception::Usage >>> -- thrown when Getopt::Lucid methods are
called incorrectly

=item *

C<<< Getopt::Lucid::Exception::Spec >>> -- thrown when the specification array
contains incorrect or invalid data

=item *

C<<< Getopt::Lucid::Exception::ARGV >>> -- thrown when the command-line is
processed and fails to pass specified validation, requirements, or is
otherwise determined to be invalid

=back

These exception may be caught using an C<<< eval >>> block and allow the calling
program to respond differently to each class of exception.

   my $opt;
   eval { $opt = Getopt::Lucid->getopt( \@spec ) };
   if ($@) {
     print "$@\n" && print_usage() && exit 1
       if ref $@ eq 'Getopt::Lucid::Exception::ARGV';
     ref $@ ? $@->rethrow : die $@;
   }

=head2 Ambiguous Cases and Gotchas

=head3 One-character aliases and C<<< anycase >>>

   @spec = (
     Counter("verbose|v")->anycase,
     Switch("version|V")->anycase,
   );

Consider the spec above.  By specifying C<<< anycase >>> on these, "verbose",
"Verbose", "VERBOSE" are all acceptable, as are "version", "Version" and so on.
(Including long-form versions of these, too, if "magic" mode is used.)
However, what if the command line has "-v" or even "-v -V"?  In this case, the
rule is that exact case matches are used before case-insensitive matches are
searched.  Thus, "-v" can only match "verbose", despite the C<<< anycase >>>
modification, and likewise "-V" can only match "version".

=head3 Identical names except for dashes and underscores

   @spec = (
     Param("input-file"),
     Switch("input_file"),
   );

Consider the spec above.  These are two, separate, valid options, but a call to
the accessor C<<< get_input_file >>> is ambiguous and may return either option,
depending on which first satisfies a "fuzzy-matching" algorithm inside the
accessor code.  Avoid identical names with mixed dash and underscore styles.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

  $opt = Getopt::Lucid->new( \@option_spec );
  $opt = Getopt::Lucid->new( \@option_spec, \%parameters );
  $opt = Getopt::Lucid->new( \@option_spec, \@option_array );
  $opt = Getopt::Lucid->new( \@option_spec, \@option_array, \%parameters );

Creates a new Getopt::Lucid object.  An array reference to an option spec is
required as an argument.  (See L</USAGE> for a description of the object spec).
By default, objects will be set to read @ARGV for command line options. An
optional second argument with a reference to an array will use that array for
option processing instead.  The final argument may be a hashref of parameters.
The only valid parameter currently is:

=over

=item *

strict -- enables strict mode when true

=back

For typical cases, users will likely prefer to call C<<< getopt >>> instead, which
creates a new object and parses the command line with a single function call.

=head2 validate()

   $opt->validate();
   $opt->validate( \%arguments );

Takes an optional argument hashref, validates that all requirements and
prerequisites are met or throws an error.  Valid argument keys are:

=over

=item *

C<<< requires >>> -- an arrayref of options that must exist in the options
object.

=back

This method returns the object for convenient chaining:

   $opt = Getopt::Lucid->getopt(\@spec)->validate;

=head2 append_defaults()

  %options = append_defaults( %config_hash );
  %options = append_defaults( \%config_hash );

Takes a hash or hash reference of new default values, modifies the stored
defaults, recalculates the result of processing the command line with the
revised defaults, and returns a hash with the resulting options.  Each
keyE<sol>value pair in the passed hash is added to the stored defaults.  For Switch
and Param options, the value in the passed hash will overwrite any
preexisting value.  For Counter options, the value is added to any
preexisting value.  For List options, the value (or values, if the value is an
array reference) will be pushed onto the end of the list of existing values.
For Keypair options, the keyE<sol>value pairs will be added to the existing hash,
overwriting existing keyE<sol>value pairs (just like merging two hashes).  Keys
which are not valid names from the options specification will be ignored.

=head2 defaults()

  %defaults = $opt->defaults();

Returns a hash containing current default values.  Keys are names from the
option specification (without any leading dashes).  These defaults represent
the baseline values that are modified by the parsed command line options.

=head2 getopt()

  $opt = Getopt::Lucid->getopt( \@option_spec );
  $opt = Getopt::Lucid->getopt( \@option_spec, \@option_array );
  $opt->getopt();

Parses the command line array (@ARGV by default).  When called as a class
function, C<<< getopt >>> takes the same arguments as C<<< new >>>, calls C<<< new >>> to create
an object before parsing the command line, and returns the new object.  When
called as an object method, it takes no arguments and returns itself.

For convenience, CE<lt>getopts()E<gt> is a alias for CE<lt>getopt()E<gt>.

=head2 merge_defaults()

  %options = merge_defaults( %config_hash );
  %options = merge_defaults( \%config_hash );

Takes a hash or hash reference of new default values, modifies the stored
defaults, recalculates the result of processing the command line with the
revised defaults, and returns a hash with the resulting options.  Each
keyE<sol>value pair in the passed hash is added to the stored defaults, overwriting
any preexisting value.  Keys which are not valid names from the options
specification will be ignored.

=head2 names()

  @names = $opt->names();

Returns the list of names in the options specification.  Each name represents a
key in the hash of options provided by C<<< options >>>.

=head2 options()

  %options = $opt->options();

Returns a deep copy of the options hash.  Before C<<< getopt >>> is called, its
behavior is undefined.  After C<<< getopt >>> is called, this will return the
result of modifying the defaults with the results of command line processing.

=head2 replace_defaults()

  %options = replace_defaults( %config_hash );
  %options = replace_defaults( \%config_hash );

Takes a hash or hash reference of new default values, replaces the stored
defaults, recalculates the result of processing the command line with the
revised defaults, and returns a hash with the resulting options.  Each
keyE<sol>value pair in the passed hash replaces existing defaults, including those
given in the option specifications.  Keys which are not valid names from the
option specification will be ignored.

=head2 reset_defaults()

  %options = reset_defaults();

Resets the stored defaults to the original values from the options
specification, recalculates the result of processing the command line with the
restored defaults, and returns a hash with the resulting options.  This
undoes the effect of a C<<< merge_defaults >>> or C<<< add_defaults >>> call.

=head1 API CHANGES
